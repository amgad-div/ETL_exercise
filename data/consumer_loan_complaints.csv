1a1448a4-bfe5-455f-bc29-dc79ec5fb2c0,05/13/2016,Consumer Loan,Account terms and changes,"NONE OF YOUR "" MY LOAN IS A '' below apply to this situation! This was a car loan but the company is providing fraudulent information this is damaging my credit! 

RE : MidAtlantic Finance Company Account No. XXXX - NOT TO BE CONFUSED with my current MAF loan MidAtlantic Finance Company has reported several false items to all XXXX credit reporting agencies, and continues to do so. It is damaging my credit so much so that I was told I did n't qualify for a mortgage. 

Most recently, I settled this account per agreement on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, yet MAF reported it is a payment on the amount claimed owed ( which has been disputed since XXXX XXXX ). But that is just the most recent false information that was reported. It is showing a debt of {$250.00} per month along with XXXX different amounts charged off of the {$950.00} ( plus interest ) and another {$5100.00} that INCLUDES the {$950.00}. Please refer to the following as I NEVER owed MAF {$8100.00} as it reported. That was the original amount financed in XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX, and I made payments of {$250.00} a month through XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. 
1 ) Car was purchased in XXXX XXXX and was financed IN HOUSE until XXXX XXXX per MAF 's statement of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, with my first payment being due to MAF XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I was not responsible for any prior late payments ( MAF recorded my first delinquency as XXXX XXXX ) and that should never have been on my credit report. I do not know why or HOW it can be considered owned by MAF since XXXX XXXX. 
2 ) There was NEVER a charge-off of {$5100.00} for the following reasons : a. Car was totaled XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I paid the {$250.00} XXXX payment plus additional interest fees on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The insurance company paid {$4200.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, leaving a balance per MAF of {$950.00} ( disputed since XXXX XXXX ) ; b. I was given a payoff in XXXX XXXX of {$5200.00}, with no expiration date, so I disputed the {$950.00} for 18 months before giving up. Finally, MAF sent me the accounting in XXXX XXXX, which supports my claim of payments made and wrongfully charged-off amounts. 
3 ) On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, this account was PAID IN FULL per MAF 's own letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, yet MAF did not comply with the verbal agreement with its representative XXXX XXXX to remove negative credit AND it applied the {$500.00} as a payment toward the ( disputed ) balance owed rather than showing Paid in Full. 
The included supporting documents are as follows in a single PDF and numbered accordingly : 1 ) MAF - Accounting XXXX XXXX - received from MAF in XXXX XXXX - all writing on the page is by someone at MAF. This is a scan of exactly what I received. I was unaware that XXXX allegedly had my account prior to XXXX XXXX as all payments were made directly to the car dealership prior to XXXX XXXX. MAF accounting shows only {$950.00} ( disputed ) owed as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
2 ) MAF - Payoff XXXX XXXX XXXX - Receipts showing XXXX was sent to MAF on XXXX XXXX, XXXX prior to payoff deadline of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, for the agreed amount of {$500.00}. Also sticky note from conversation on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, with XXXX XXXX prior to making XXXX payment later that day. 
3 ) MAF - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - Screenshot of email from XXXX XXXX TWELVE days after payoff with the agreement referenced below attached that she said she previously was remiss in sending. By then MAF had my payment of {$500.00} since XXXX XXXX and 9 days past the deadline. 
4 ) MAF - Agreement XX/XX/XXXX - Agreement clearly stating that if the {$500.00} was paid by XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my account would be considered "" settlement of the account '' yet MAF has reported it as a PAYMENT.",AL,,Web,05/13/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,Yes,1924047

There fore I am requesting XXXX XXXX be totally removed. As far as Wells Fargo goes, I never missed a payment, but was late on one. But paid the agreed upon contract amount. Instead of calling me as the cosignor, they called my daughter who is a college student. I thought they were offers of credit increases when she told me they called, because they had called before. When I pulled my credit report and realized the account was closed, I called them and asked, how can you close an account in which you are receiving an on time monthly payment on, and they said, it was several months where I did n't pay the full amount and they called the cosigner, XXXX XXXX. I told them I was the cosigner. And then I asked, since they knew I was an XXXX, why did n't they call me? They told me they could only call one person on the account and they chose to call her. I asked them, Where was that law? Needless to say they did n't have an answer. I informed them that all it took was a simple phone call to me to could have resolved this before they went to the extreme. I told them that I was legally entitled to receive a phone call especially before they closed the account. I informed them that I was paying the account off shortly and I did. I opened this account to assist my daughter in building credit and this is ruining her start on life.

8b220481-5dd3-4ca9-8409-a632987b1072,05/26/2015,Consumer Loan,Account terms and changes,"I have had a long standing, perfect pay history, line of credit with Citibank. It is important to maintain a good credit score and I monitor mine. Citibank pulled out of Texas and sold all branches to XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a result, my 8 year, perfect standing, on-time payments, very low balance, line of credit with Citibank was closed and moved to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The problem is that XXXX XXXX XXXX now shows a new line of credit. The CFPB should dictate that when banks move accounts between each other, the acquiring bank must use the original open date of the credit / loan. The time the loan is open, on-time payments, and low percentage outstanding all contribute to a higher credit score. With NO action on the consumer 's part, my credit score went down by over XXXX points month-over-month because the several positives with Citibank, became slight negatives with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( new credit, new credit inquiry, no payment history ). No other changes occurred on my credit reports ( except slightly lower balances on month-end cycles on XXXX credit cards as compared to previous month - which should have resulted in an increased credit score ). In my case, my excellent credit rating went down to good but many other consumers would have been more detrimentally impacted. This is an opportunity for the CFPB to make the banks change their account conversion / account acquisition practices, and methods to not negatively impact the consumer. Of course the consumer credit score effects the rating and interest rate on new credit, extension of credit, etc. This complaint should be directed against both Citibank and XXXX XXXX XXXX.",FL,327XX,Web,05/26/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1392306

Payment check referenced the last XXXX numbers of the auto loan ( as it was on the billing statement ). USAA, with whom I have both a credit card ( in default/very late as payments were insufficient ) and an auto loan, refuses to credit the amount to my auto loan. I expect soon to have my car repossessed, though I should have been current with payments. ( I stopped making payments the last 3 months while the USAA was supposed to be sorting this out. Now when I call and I get placed on terminal hold, such as 20 minutes today without anyone picking up after my call was forwarded. Online logs me off repeatedly when trying to get my information, noting that I have unresolved charges. This evening, when trying to gather documents for this complaint, I have been unable to access the information online. When I actually got to speak to people initially ( months ago ), they noted that no payments were shown on my accounts and that obviously my bank was in error. Then, when I pulled up the cancelled checks, the person insisted, as if it was an acceptable explanation, that they have XXXX checks that they process each day.

cb8367da-0476-45cb-b911-143be6f86848,09/15/2015,Consumer Loan,Account terms and changes,"Opened a line of credit with Fortiva Servicing ; however, the line of credit was reported as closed to all credit bureaus. I 've submitted a compliant with XXXX credit reporting agency but have not yet heard back regarding the results. I did contact Fortiva Servicing regarding the reason why the account was closed and it was stated to me that due to the account being inactive for 3 months, the account was reported as "" closed at consumer request '' since I had paid off the balance to avoid incurring additional interest charges. I stated to the representative that I never authorized for the account to be closed and that it was negatively impacting my credit report ( due to the account still being considered "" new '' and being closed in a short amount of time, as well as bringing down the amount of open lines I have ) and they stated to me there was nothing they could do. I stated to them this is not something that is in my terms and conditions ( account closure within 3 months due to inactivity ) and that it is misleading to the customer to not provide crucial terms information that could impact their credit report and the most they could do ( after the XXXX attempt at contacting them for a resolution ) was tell me I would need to call every 3 months after the account is closed to have it reopened. 

This account was opened at a XXXX spa ( XXXX XXXX ) to pay for services used there, as needed. Upon contacting the merchant, they also stated this was something they 've never heard before but due to privacy reason, they was not much they could do as Fortiva Servicing is a third party vendor. 

The concern is, how can a company close out an account due to reasons a customer was never notified about nor agreed to upon signing the contract terms and conditions? Had I known that a line of credit would be closed due to inactivity after 3 months, I would have never agreed to opening the account. Additionally, as I am currently pregnant, XXXX is not advisable during the term of the XXXX so I can not feasibly use the account until after delivery anyways ( I volunteered this information to them, all XXXX times I called them ). They stated to me, if I do not call to have the account reopened or if too much time laspes between the time the account is closed by them and the time I call them to reopen it, I would need to reapply for a new account to be open. ( again, another impact to my credit report ). 

I spoke to XXXX different representatives, all providing me with different information. Ultimately, upon speaking to a supervisor ( after being on hold for almost XXXX minutes ), was when they agreed to reinstate my account but that I would need to continue calling every 3 months to reinstate the account each time. 

The XXXX time I called, I was told without any evidence of negative impact, there was nothing that could be done. The XXXX contact ( this time via email ), I was told that if I did not use the account within 3 months, I would need to reapply for a new account and the account would reactivate only if used within 3 months and ultimately, upon the XXXX call to a supervisor, was when the account was agreed to be re-reported to the bureaus as opened and active, but only for 3 more months. The supervisor checked the terms and agreement while I was on the line and agreed, this condition ( maintaining the account active for 3 consecutive months ) was not stated anywhere.",MA,021XX,Web,09/29/2015,Closed,Yes,Yes,1565153

a8899721-ee98-468e-b288-173340d5bef7,04/14/2016,Consumer Loan,Managing the line of credit,"Made monthly online-pymts to Fortiva- paid the said amount per the webpage. Fortiva reporting to credit bureaus as late- no help with correcting. I opened up an account ( Account # XXXX ) with Fortiva in XXXX with a credit limit of {$1500.00}. In late XXXX XXXX, I received my credit reports and I noticed Fortiva reported me late to the credit bureaus several times in XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX -30 days late XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX -60 days late XXXX XXXX -90 days late I knew this could n't be correct because I paid at least the monthly minimum amount of what the statement said via the online website. 
XXXX XXXX paid {$75.00} Confirm # XXXX XXXX XXXX paid {$75.00} Confirm # XXXX XXXX XXXX paid {$78.00} Confirm # XXXX XXXX XXXX paid {$63.00} Confirm # XXXX There was n't a statement generated in XXXX ( unsure of the reason- Fortiva acknowledges that error in a response received via XXXX ). There was n't a payment made in XXXX XXXX because the online payment site stated the next payment of {$100.00} ( minimum ) was due on XXXX XXXX XXXX. I understood that this account is an installment account that fluctuates up/down monthly depending on your balance. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed Fortiva XXXX certified letters ( XXXX to the CEO/Director and XXXX to Corporate Dispute Center ) to include my compliant, online screenshots of my account statements showing what to pay and payments made. I also filed a complaint with the XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, I received a XXXX page, XXXX sentence letter from Fortiva thanking me for being a valued customer but after a review of my account the reporting 's are accurate and no error has been found on their part, but feel free to call customer service if I have any other questions. No signature or a person 's name was on the letter. Talk about HORRIBLE customer service! They blew me off, as they do when I call customer service. I was expecting a history of receipts from Fortiva showing my full payment history, all transactions dealing with the account, a typed, signed-response and a courtesy statement saying as a 1x courtesy the credit reports will be updated due to all past errors and my experience to say the least. Fortiva did respond back to the XXXX on XXXX XXXX and they stated that they credited my account {$100.00} in late fees but declined to update my credit report as paid on time. 
I advised the XXXX that I did not accept the response and I wanted my credit report updated correctly because of Fortiva ' s website error. The only option to make payments on your account is mail, online or over the phone. You do n't have the option to go inside a store and make your payments, so being that this account is a revolving account, how was I to know that the minimum amount online was n't correct? 
Fortiva responded on XXXX XXXX with a breakdown of my account history ( which is n't available online ). Also declining to correct my credit report. 
XXXX information attached* To prove my point I have attached XXXX statement screenshots ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) that I was able to save. Fortiva mentioned in their statement that on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX a statement generated for a min of {$360.00} due. Fortiva reported me to the credit bureaus as 90 days late as of XXXX XXXX. However my online screenshot DATED : XXXX XXXX XXXX, shows XXXX {$100.00} due XXXX XXXX XXXX with no past due outstanding. Fortiva stated in the XXXX response that a statement generated on XXXX XXXX stating a MIN of {$120.00} was owed in XXXX, I paid {$180.00} in total ( {$86.00} XXXX XXXX and {$100.00} - XXXX XXXX ). They then stated I owed {$21.00} for XXXX but my online screenshot shows {$0.00} due for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I did n't make a payment in XXXX because it said {$0.00} due online. 
Also, the online system does n't update in real-time even after you make a payment. To prove my point I have attached a before and after screenshot for XXXX statement which states {$42.00} due by XXXX XXXX. Just paid {$21.00} on today and system still reflects {$42.00} due by XXXX XXXX.

So, as I was shopping for a new car, my banker who ran a credit check for a car loan alerted me that, I was unintentionally remiss in payment for a bill from Walmart under {$50.00} at the time I relocated.

So, when I called Synchrony Bank which was the collector for the Walmart debt, I explained myself and offered the new balance of {$170.00} which included late fees from Walmart. 

Synchrony checked my story, and I was told that I did not have to pay the {$170.00} and that my Walmart Credit card would be reinstated. They told me that the delinquency mark would be removed from my Credit Report within ten days. 

However, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from Synchrony Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX, that my account "" was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. 

Since, then I had received multiple calls form XXXX and spoke with several agents there, telling and re-telling my experience with Synchrony countless times, but to no avail. I have a cellphone billing record of these calls to and from both Synchrony and XXXX during the ensuing months. 

Finally, after much misleading information and confusion, I submitted the payment of {$160.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, ( new Acct # ... ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I have written to all XXXX credit reporting agencies ( XXXX is the credit reporting agency that referred me to the XXXX which is where I located CFPB ).

XX/XX/XXXX replaced transmission, I was advised by the service person they had left the old wave plate on and attached the new transmission. XX/XX/XXXX my check engine light came on by XX/XX/XXXX failed my emission test due to the check engine light ; carried papers from emission for the service to sign for the light to be overridden which lasted long enough for me to pass emission. Light came back on no sooner than I parked in my drive way. From this point with no assistance from XXXX service department was OFFERED to get the car diagnosed. For the recommended tire/battery/steering rack/coolant yes they were all denied. MY ISSUE WAS THE CHECK ENGING LIGHT PERIOD. I was told to record or video if the car starts to do anything. Finally was able to do this when I let the service guys there see this clip I was told all I needed was a battery. Shortly after I found a hole in the manifold intake value which was suppose to have been fixed.To this date service guys has lied about the many times I came to get something done about the issue ; gave date of when they say the car was diagnosed at XXXX, which is records of one time the car was there after transmission replacement. Yes they are to this point call me a liar because I declined a battery and tires etc. On XX/XX/XXXX the heater hose failed due to the check engine light was already on I had no warning. Car towed to garage, now they are saying short block part of the engine failure to a bad to worst situation now service denied warranty. The car sat unrepaired for 60 days, XX/XX/XXXX I removed my personal belongs and found a open container of antifreeze, OK on the floor of the car where my grandchildren would be sitting, "" yes the service department put that there ''. I wish it could have been dusted for fingerprints ; my prints would not be on the container. The dealership wanted me to pay {$3500.00} to fix the car. NO WAY. I made a decision to surrender the car back I guess the only satisfaction I will get from this the car was in my BKO do n't owe a dime! I am still thinking on this issue because there was no REASON FOR SERVICE TO BE DENIED..MANUAL SAYS CHECK ENGINE LIGHT GET TO YOUR NEAREST SERVICE DEPARTMEMT. I did all I was suppose to do I tried honestly to get service.

I called to correct this problem, I was told by West Lake staff that they did not have my social security number. I sent the necessary information, which was requested by West Lake in order for them to begin reporting. I called XX/XX/XXXX because I was informed by the credit repair company that I was working with at the time that West Lake was still not reporting, mind you I have been in good standings with them throughout the duration of my loan in attempt to rebuild my credit. So I was told to send the same information again so I did. I went to purchase a newer car last week and to my surprise West Lake is still not reporting. I called and spoke with numerous customer service reps and supervisors and this time they told me they have my information from when it was sent XX/XX/XXXX but I need to send it again via fax and call back so they could pull it and add it to my file. I was told after this they would begin posting immediately. I did as I was advised, however once I called back the story changed I began getting the run around and was advised to email it because they can not receive fax.

c3b926dd-c061-42f6-a9f7-173b24eadec5,09/06/2016,Consumer Loan,Account terms and changes,"2010 Ford Focus I purchased my vehicle XX/XX/XXXX from a used car lot XXXX in XXXX XXXX California. While getting a quote for auto insurance I was informed of an XXXX dollar accident my car had been in. That day I reached out to my Finance Company I had received my car loan from and they told me my car had a Salvaged Title. After some research in to California auto sales laws and a laundry list my car was of issues from a third party mechanic inspection, I called my financing company and told them that I was never informed of a Salvage Title or received any kind of car facts before signing my contract they promised they would get back to me saying that they would do everything they could to help. I called and called trying to follow finally getting to speak to a supervisor who promised she would work on my case and never heard from her again. 

In XXXX XXXX I took my vehicle in to XXXX XXXX car lot in XXXX California in attempt to trade in my vehicle for something a little more dependable. XXXX XXXX then denied my request as he told me my car was only worth {$2500.00} dollars which Im sure was a rough estimate, mind you Im paying {$15000.00} to fulfill my contract. He then asked if I had the paper work for my car with me which thankfully I did. He took a look and within seconds told me my contract should have had "" SALVAGE TITLE '' printed all over the background, that my gap waiver had issues and that I had total recourse. 

I have reached out to the DMV Department of Investigations with no response. 
I have taken my vehicle back to the seller many times only to receive it with the same exact issues waiting more than a week each time. 
i 've informed both the seller and Financing company of my griefs with absolutely no resolution. 
I 've never been late on a payment, I would just like the chance to work with an honest Financing company and drive a car that does n't need constant repairs or shut off at every red light. 

I a XXXX year old buying his first vehicle with his own name and money being taken advantage of and lied to. 

I pay {$280.00} a month have had to be credited money for being charged extra interest by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ca XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX",CA,92587,Web,09/09/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2097159

They tell me they have no record of running my credit. Called XXXX and was told the only way they can do anything is with a deletion letter. 

So I guess XXXX has no authority or remedies here when there 's potential fraud, seems a bit short sighted to not have some built in protection or authority required by credit agencies. Then again, they 're here to sell us that protection, way to go on that one, someone 's always looking for a way to take our money. 

Since they have no authority, let 's use up your time and some of our tax dollars. Since we 're paying for you to do this job, you might as well do the credit reporting that the bureaus do. 

I need to find out what 's going on here and have this removed, thank you",WI,,Web,09/06/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2067005

bf651efe-a5af-4663-906d-7dc322e31578,05/26/2015,Consumer Loan,Account terms and changes,"I have had a long standing, perfect pay history, line of credit with XXXX. It is important to maintain a good credit score and I monitor mine. XXXX pulled out of Texas and sold all branches to BB & T. As a result, my 8 year, perfect standing, on-time payments, very low balance, line of credit with XXXX was closed and moved to BB & T. The problem is that BB & T now shows a new line of credit. The CFPB should dictate that when banks move accounts between each other, the acquiring bank must use the original open date of the credit / loan. The time the loan is open, on-time payments, and low percentage outstanding all contribute to a higher credit score. With NO action on the consumer 's part, my credit score went down by over XXXX points month-over-month because the several positives with XXXX, became slight negatives with BB & T ( new credit, new credit inquiry, no payment history ). No other changes occurred on my credit reports ( except slightly lower balances on month-end cycles on XXXX credit cards as compared to previous month - which should have resulted in an increased credit score ). In my case, my excellent credit rating went down to good but many other consumers would have been more detrimentally impacted. This is an opportunity for the CFPB to make the banks change their account conversion / account acquisition practices, and methods to not negatively impact the consumer. Of course the consumer credit score effects the rating and interest rate on new credit, extension of credit, etc. This complaint should be directed against both XXXX and BB & T.",FL,327XX,Web,05/26/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1392307

In XXXX 2016 I made a online purchase using Paypal Credit with the agreement that I had 6 months no payments and no interest expiring XXXX XXXX 2016. On or about the XX/XX/2016 I linked my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX savings account to my Paypal account ( via Paypal web site ) with the intent of paying that debt in full before the XXXX XXXX deadline, I was advised electronically that Paypal would be making XXXX small withdraws from that account within 2-3 days for confirmation before the account would become active and that I should review my XXXX XXXX XXXX statement for confirmation. After about a week I had not seen any withdraws from my XXXX XXXX account and contacted Paypal via telephone, their automated phone system is very difficult and confusing to navigate and took several attempts and several minutes to speak to a agent directly, after explaining to the agent that I had not yet received confirmation he checked my Paypal account and advised me that the XXXX XXXX savings account was confirmed, was active and I was good to go, I thanked him, hung up the phone and immediately scheduled a payment ( via my Paypal Credit account ) for the full amount, on XXXX XXXX 2016, from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account that is listed on my Paypal account, the scheduled payment appeared on my Paypal Credit account. 
Over the next couple weeks I made a couple small online purchases via Paypal using the above mentioned XXXX XXXX Savings account and received several emails from Paypal and XXXX XXXX that those payments were denied and as there was well more then enough funds to cover those payments as well as the scheduled payment on XXXX XXXX I contacted Paypal via phone again navigating thru their very confusing, frustrating automated phone system I made contact with an agent, after expressing my displeasure regarding their phone system I inquired as to the reason those payments were denied. After checking my account he explained to me that my bank ( XXXX XXXX ) does not allow electronic payments from savings accounts, I advised him that I accepted his explanation regarding XXXX XXXX but that I was very displeased with Paypal and expressed that displeasure very adamantly as I had payments being denied and a large payment scheduled for XXXX XXXX and Paypal advised me I could use that account, he further explained to me that those payments were made using another bank account listed on my Paypal account. I apologized, explaining that my displeasure was not with him rather with Paypal for giving me the go ahead to use that account and hung up. That night I logged on to my Paypal account to insure the payment for XXXX XXXX and quickly learned that my account was in a limited status, somehow while I was navigating thru their automated phone system I triggered a security feature, I phoned them again and was able to fix that. the next day approx. XXXX XXXX I phoned them again for the sole purpose of making sure the payment scheduled for XXXX XXXX was still on, they bounced me between agents and departments, I did as they instructed me and was under the impression that everything was fine, On XXXX XXXX I checked my bank account and the funds for that payment were still there, I phoned Paypal again and was advised no payment was scheduled and that I now owed {$310.00} in interest and fees, I paid the original loan and phoned their customer service the next day, I was advised there was nothing they could do, I asked to speak to a supervisor and was advised their supervisor does n't take phone calls, I asked review all phone calls regarding this matter, they said they would and replied via email that the would not waive finance charges and fees",CA,925XX,Web,11/01/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2189866

I was n't notified and I did n't sign anything. Why? Because they did n't inform me until I was 2-3 months late. I could n't pay that much at one time because I 'm on a fixed income.

98108f9e-79d8-4e85-b7c8-cbe1cd016df6,08/04/2015,Consumer Loan,Shopping for a line of credit,"On Friday XXXX XXXX my husband and I ordered something on E-bay for {$9.00}. When we chose our credit card that we have in PayPal, which is a XXXX to pay for it, it came back and said it was denied because we needed to send updated credit card information. So we went back in to PayPal to update our credit card information, which we did, purchased the item for {$9.00} from the seller, got the confirmation from the seller that the credit card was approved and it was being shipped. We were unaware that during this process of updating our credit card we were pressing a PayPal Credit key that was authorizing PayPal Credit to give us a line of credit with PayPal Credit. When we checked our email we had not only the confirmation of the item we purchased form the seller, we had another email from PayPal Credit congratulating us that we had been approved for a {$4500.00} line of credit with PayPal Credit. To our shock and dismay we found the number, which is hard to find, called them to inquire about this and the customer service rep told us that we had authorized this line of credit when we checked the box authorizing it and entered the last four of XXXX social security number. PayPal told us that we authorized this line of credit by giving our social security number and checking the box. We never signed an agreement with them. We asked to have it disappear, like we never authorized it at all and they told us that we had to cancel it but it was still on our credit report. I questioned them saying how could it happen that quickly in two minutes and they said that 's the way they do it. I asked to speak with the customer service reps manager and she obliged, so I spoke to XXXX XXXX, I explained the situation. He told me again we had authorized it, we were not scammed, and that we could cancel it but it would still appear on our credit report. I told him that was fraudulent and I felt scammed. I told him I would be pursuing this with one of the government agencies when they opened on Monday. I have not cancelled the account because I was afraid to, that that might determine I was admitting guilt for something that I opened that I did n't open.",MD,207XX,Web,08/05/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1502551
